# Online-Streaming
##Streaming Platform
A Streaming Platform allows users to stream videos or music, create playlists, and share content. The backend will use Node.js and Express to handle content management, user authentication, and streaming APIs.

MongoDB will store user data, media files, playlists, and comments. For video or music storage and delivery, you must integrate AWS S3 for media file storage and AWS CloudFront for fast content delivery.

The front end will be built with React, creating a media player interface with features like search, playlists, and content recommendations.

The desired outcome is a media streaming app that allows users to view and listen to content, manage playlists, and interact with media, giving you experience in handling large file storage, streaming, and building scalable platforms.
